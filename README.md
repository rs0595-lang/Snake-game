# 🐍 Snake Game using Python Turtle

This is a simple implementation of the classic **Snake Game** using Python's built-in `turtle` module. It's a great beginner-friendly project to understand basic game mechanics, event handling, and graphical output in Python.

## 🎮 Gameplay

- Eat the red food to grow longer
- The game ends when the snake collides with the wall or itself
- The score increases with each food eaten

## 🛠️ Features

- Real-time keyboard input handling
- Dynamic score display
- Collision detection (with walls and self)
- Growing snake length
- Modular code for easy readability and updates

## 📦 Requirements

- Python 3.x
- No external libraries required – only the built-in `turtle` module

## ▶️ How to Run

1. Make sure Python is installed on your system.
2. Clone the repository:
