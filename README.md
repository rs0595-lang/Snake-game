# Snake-game
This is a classic Snake Game built with Python using the Turtle graphics library. The player controls a snake to eat food, and each time it eats, the snake grows longer. The game ends if the snake hits the wall or itself. It's a fun, simple project for learning Python's Turtle module and basic game logic.
